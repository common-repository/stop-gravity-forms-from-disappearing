A simple plugin for ensuring that Gravity Forms never disappear.
== Description ==

Stop Gravity Forms From Disappearing solves the problem of Gravity Forms not displaying on your page.

It's a common issue with Gravity Forms: all is configured, everything is ready, the form published... but it doesn't appear on the page. It's just blank.

Stop Gravity Forms From Disappearing forces Gravity Forms to be displayed.

Note that this issue is most likely caused in case your used theme or another plugin is causing a JavaScript error, and the best way to resolve this issue is to fix the JavaScript errors. To do that, Gravity Forms first recommends running through a full theme/plugin conflict test to narrow down the cause: https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/testing-for-a-themeplugin-conflict/ and after that contacting the developer of the plugin/theme that is causing the issue.
